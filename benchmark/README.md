Some basic benchmarks. These are not very comprehensive, but hopefully point to
these are useful container types with intriguing performance characteristics:

- [lists](output/list-comparisons/index.md): compares performance of a handful
  of list types to the `Base.Vector` for `mapfoldl`, `mapreduce`, and
  `getindex`

- [dictionaries](output/dicts/index.md): compares performance of a few
  dictionary types for lookups and inserts. Uses `Base.Dict` as a comparison
  point.
