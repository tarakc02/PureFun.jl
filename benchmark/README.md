Some basic benchmarks

- [list types](output/list-comparisons/index.md): compares performance
  of a handful of list types to the `Base.Vector` for `mapfoldl`, `mapreduce`,
  and `getindex`

- [dict types](output/dicts/index.md): compares performance of a few dictionary
  types for lookups and inserts. Uses `Base.Dict` as a comparison point.
