# Purely Functional Data Structures, in Julia

```@meta
CurrentModule = PureFun
DocSetup = quote using PureFun end
```

Wherein [I](https://tarakc02.github.io/) work my way through the book [*Purely
Functional Data
Structures*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594288.Purely_Functional_Data_Structures),
but in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) instead of ML/haskell

# What is a persistent data structure?

Consider the following bit of code:

```@repl
x = 42;
y = x;
y += 1
x
```

Compare to the similar looking code:

```@repl
x = [1,2,3];
y = x;
push!(y, 4)
x
```

In the first example, changing the value of `y` did not affect the value of
`x`. However, in the second, I was able to change the contents of `x` without
re-assigning it directly! This can lead to unexpected program behavior: any
time you pass your object as an argument to a function, you can't know for sure
if the called function had the side effect of changing the contents of your
object. A workaround when you want to avoid that possibility is [defensive
copying](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=15). If we're
writing multiple small functions [as recommended in the Julia
docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Break-functions-into-multiple-definitions), this can get expensive.

Julia's base arrays, sets, and dictionaries are all mutable. This package
provides data structures that are immutable, so they can be treated as values.

```@repl
using PureFun
x = PureFun.Linked.List(1:3);
y = x;
y = pushfirst(y, 4)
x
```

# Overall design

PureFun.jl provides a bunch of different container types, each has an empty
constructor to create a new empty container of that type, and a constructor
that takes an iterable. All of the collection types satisfy the [iteration
interface](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/#man-interface-iteration)
and can be used in loops, with
[iterators](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/iterators/), etc. There are
several [functors](https://ocaml.org/docs/functors) that allow you to create
more complicated container types from simpler container types.

Whenever an immutable method has a mutating analogue in `Base`, the immutable
version of the function has the same name as the mutating one without the `!`.
For example, `push` is a non-mutating version of
[`push!`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.push!),
instead of modifying its input argument it returns a new collection with an
element added.

Examples follow.

- [Lists](@ref): insert/remove from the front of the list, get the element at
  the front of the lists, and iterate inserted elements in
  [LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) order

- [Heaps](@ref): insert elements, remove elements, retrieve the minimum, and
  iterate in sorted order (wrt an
  [`Ordering`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/#Alternate-orderings))

## PFSet

Implemented by:

- `PureFun.RedBlack.RBSet` (supports all operations in log2(n) time)
- `PureFun.RedBlack.RBSet` also supports `delete`, `delete_min`, and
  `delete_max`, and iteration order is determined by an
  [`Ordering`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/#Alternate-orderings)
  type parameter

Supports:

- `push`
- `in`, `âˆˆ`

## PFDict

Implemented by:

- `PureFun.RedBlack.RBDict` (supports all operations in log2(n) time)

Supports:

- `setindex`, `getindex`
- `PureFun.RedBlack.RBDict` also supports `delete`, `delete_min`, and
  `delete_max`, and iteration order is determined by an
  [`Ordering`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/#Alternate-orderings)
  type parameter

## PFHeap

Implemented by:

- `PureFun.Pairing.Heap`: 
- `PureFun.SkewHeap.Heap`: 
- `PureFun.FastMerging.Heap`:
